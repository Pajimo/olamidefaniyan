# Olamide Faniyan
Personal portfolio


Quick introduction. 

My name is Olamide and I am a front end developer looking to secure my first full time position as a developer.

I was introducted into programming in 2016 while in the university, I am a recent graduate in computer science with a second class upper grade. 

Recently I have pushed myself beyond my comfort zone in creating applications that require me to think and possible ask for help among seasonsed developers. 

My latest and personally impressed work is the tvseries (https://series-purge.vercel.app/) application i created with Next.js, TMDB-API, TailwindCSS, and FIresbase auth /Firebase-Firestore, it was a very challenging application as i have not gone as far in testing my skills. 

I have built a couple of web applications and I recently got interested in mobile (React Native)

I have project based experience in using 
- Next.js
- React.js
- JavaScript
- Html/CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebbase / Firestore
- Fetch-API
- Material UI
- GitHub / Git
